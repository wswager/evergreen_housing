# Business Problem

Evergreen Housing is a new house flipping startup looking to establish themselves in the east suburbs of Seattle, Washington.

House flipping is purchasing properties with the intent of selling them with the goal of making a profit.

In order to make a profit, most house flips involve improvements to the home which increase the value.  However, the cost of these improvements must be accounted for, so earning a profit requires selling for more than the amount paid initially plus plus the cost of the improvements.  

The most common improvements will be basic repairs and/or cosmetic renovations, however, for some properties Evergreen Housing may look to make more significant additions to the house via construction.

In order to better assess whether additions which require construction are worthwhile, Evergreen Housing have requested input regarding which features will increase the value of homes and a model predicting pricing.
